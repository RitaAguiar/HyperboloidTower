# HyperboloidTower
3D Model of an Hyperboloid Tower - developed in Racket using the Rosetta tool in DrRacket and generated and rendered in AutoCAD. Post production - Photoshop.
Later, I developed this work in Python using the Khepry tool in Python for Rhino and generated and rendered in Rhinoceros.
