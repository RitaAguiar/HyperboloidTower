# HyperboloidTower
3D Model of an Hyperboloid Tower - developed in Racket using the Rosetta tool in DrRacket and generated and rendered in AutoCAD. Post production - Photoshop.
I have also developed this work in Python using the Khepry tool in Python for Rhino and generated and in Rhinoceros. Now, also in Julia, also developed with the Khepri tool!
